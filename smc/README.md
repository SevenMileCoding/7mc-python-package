# SevenMileCoding PyPackage (smc)
A Python package developed by Seven Mile Coding for use in our program.

### Motivation
We want to create a fun learning environment that provides abstractions and tools for new programmers to use so they can start seeing the results of their programming knowledge quickly. This way they can start developing their own ideas quickly, or even try out different modules to find out what they like to make.


# Contents
